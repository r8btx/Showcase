# Showcase

Want to show pictures, videos, and/or slideshows to your guests but make sure no one messes around your computer?
**Showcase** may be able to help. It forces your display to be on while preventing user input.
To exit the program, you just need to lock your computer by pressing `Win+L` or `Ctrl+Alt+Del`.

## Getting Started

Download or copy desired scripts and execute them. Some may require admin/root privileges to function properly.
Showcase.py requires admin privilege.
